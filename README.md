# Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction
This repository contains an analysis with aim of predicting the closing price of cryptocurrencies.

Understanding the Context
After the boom and bust of cryptocurrenciesâ€™ prices in recent years, cryptocurrencies have been increasingly regarded as an investment asset. Because of their highly volatile nature, there is a need for good predictions on which to base investment decisions. Different existing studies have leveraged machine learning for more accurate cryptocurrency price prediction. We are interested in applying different modeling techniques to samples with different data structures (qualitative and quantitative data) and dimensional features to achieve an optimization in price prediction.

**NB:** The target value is the actual price. We have data extracted in an interval of 1h for a period of one year (from 1st of March 2020 to 1st of March 2021). We are interested in predicting the values of cryptocurrency prices in specific timestamps that we have in the validation file.
